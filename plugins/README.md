### Saftey Notice

While care is taken when reviewing plugins, we do not accept responsibility for any damage or malicious software installed from the use of a plugin not provided by either @sdstudios or @sdstudios-testing. There are the only 2 "offical" users that have genuinely trusted code.

Any other user saying they are from the SDStudios team, and are asking for you to install a official or "maintainance" plugin are probably attempting to hijack your TSAB instance.

Not really related to safey, but hey. These plugins are designed for TSAB, not any other bot, bot framework or bot libarary. They may work,. but they most likely won't.
